## Presentation

**The Órama Investidor's Guide** was developed during [MegaHack](https://www.megahack.com.br/) 5th edition. Among the challenges available at the event, we from team 2 "o quarteto fantástico" chose the [Órama investimentos](https://www.orama.com.br/) challenge. 

The description of challenge said: **"Develop a way to present investment products and services in a more user-friendly, simplified way that meets the best user experience practices applied by companies like Netflix and Spotify. The goal is to communicate with the public in a clear way and using less “economics”. "**


From that we had the idea of ​​creating the this! 
Where the platform indicates the types of investments according to the user's profile. In it we insert our expenses and our financial inputs, and from that the platform identifies our financial profile and gives us tips.


Another feature is the possibility to learn more about financial education.

**The application is still in production.**


## What is MEGAHACK

**The biggest online hackathon in Brazil** carried out by [Shawee](https://shawee.io/) could not carry another name, except: MEGA!

Great not only for breaking geographical barriers, but also for the dimension of the journey it provides to its participants. Mega Hack is Mount Everest of the hackathons, and it takes preparation to reach the top.

There will be 11 days, 10 different challenges to choose from and endless possibilities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
